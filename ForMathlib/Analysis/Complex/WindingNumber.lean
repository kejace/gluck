# The winding number of a continuous loop in the plane

Mathlib's Cauchy-integral machinery yields winding numbers only for holomorphic/rectifiable
data.  This file constructs the **topological** winding number of a merely continuous curve
`γ : C(I, ℂ)` about a point `w` avoided by it, via covering-space path lifting of the radially
normalised curve `t ↦ (γ t - w) / ‖γ t - w‖` along the exponential covering
`Circle.exp : ℝ → S¹` (`Circle.isCoveringMap_exp`): a continuous angle lift `φ` exists, and the
winding number is the total angle increment `(φ 1 - φ 0) / (2 * π)`.

## Main definitions

* `Complex.windingNumberAt w γ hγ`: the winding number (total argument variation divided by
  `2 * π`, a real number) of the continuous curve `γ` about the point `w`.
* `Complex.circleLoop F c R hF`: the boundary loop `t ↦ F (circleMap c R (2 * π * t))` of a
  function continuous on the circle with center `c` and radius `|R|`, bundled as `C(I, ℂ)`.

## Main results

* `Complex.windingNumberAt_congr`: the winding number depends only on the values of the curve.
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_eq_div_of_lift`: the fundamental **computation rule**: from any
  explicit polar angle lift `γ t - w = ‖γ t - w‖ * exp (φ t * I)`, the winding number is the
  total increment `(φ 1 - φ 0) / (2 * π)`.
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_const`: a constant curve has winding number `0`.
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_mul`: **degree additivity** about the origin: the winding number of
  a pointwise product of nonvanishing curves is the sum of the winding numbers; consequently a
  constant nonzero factor is invisible (`Complex.windingNumberAt_const_mul`).
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_congr_sameRay`: the winding number depends only on the unit
  direction field `t ↦ (γ t - w) / ‖γ t - w‖`: curves whose direction vectors from `w` lie
  pointwise on the same ray have equal winding numbers.
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_pos_smul`: scaling the vector from the center by a continuous
  strictly positive scalar field preserves the winding number.
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_eq_of_norm_sub_lt`: the **continuous Rouché theorem**
  ("dog-on-a-leash", symmetric Estermann form): closed loops with
  `‖γ' t - γ t‖ < ‖γ t - w‖ + ‖γ' t - w‖` have equal winding numbers about `w`; both
  nonvanishing conditions are derived from the hypothesis, not assumed
  (`Complex.ne_of_norm_sub_lt_left`, `Complex.ne_of_norm_sub_lt_right`).
* `Complex.windingNumberAt_circleLoop_id`: **normalisation**: the standard parametrisation
  of the circle with center `c` and radius `R > 0` winds exactly once about `c`; the `n`-fold
  cover `t ↦ exp (2 * π * n * t * I)` winds `n` times about the origin
  (`Complex.windingNumberAt_exp_int_mul`).
* `Complex.exists_eq_of_windingNumberAt_ne_zero`: the **existence property of the planar
  Brouwer degree** (Kronecker form): if `F` is continuous on `closedBall c R`, avoids `w` on
  the boundary sphere, and its boundary loop has nonzero winding number about `w`, then `F`
  attains the value `w` in the open ball.

The lemmas `Complex.circleLoop_apply`, `Complex.circleLoop_ne` and `Complex.circleLoop_id_ne`
are the evaluation rule for `Complex.circleLoop` and the feeders filling the avoidance slot of
`windingNumberAt` for boundary loops.

## Implementation notes

`windingNumberAt w γ hγ` takes the avoidance proof `hγ : ∀ t, γ t ≠ w` as an argument rather
than being a junk-valued total function: radial normalisation is meaningless on curves through
`w`, every use site has the proof at hand anyway, and carrying it keeps the side condition out
of the statement of every lemma.  The price is that `windingNumberAt` is not congruent under
`rw` on `γ`; `windingNumberAt_congr` is the escape hatch.

The winding number is real-valued (the total argument variation divided by `2 * π`) and does
not require the curve to be closed; for closed loops it is an integer, and integrality is what
drives the homotopy-invariance proofs (a continuous integer-valued function on a connected
space is constant).  The private layer `windingNumber : C(I, Circle) → ℝ` carries the engine:
well-definedness with respect to the choice of lift (`windingNumber_eq_div_of_lift`) and
invariance under free homotopies of loops (`windingNumber_eq_of_homotopy`).

/-! ### The planar degree existence principle -/

/-- **Existence property of the planar Brouwer degree** (Kronecker form).  If `F` is
continuous on the closed ball with center `c` and radius `R > 0`, avoids the value `w` on the
boundary sphere, and its boundary loop has nonzero winding number about `w`, then `F` attains
the value `w` in the open ball.

The proof is the null-homotopy argument: were `F ≠ w` throughout, the radial contraction
`(s, t) ↦ F (c + s • (circleMap c R (2 * π * t) - c))` would be a free homotopy of loops in
`ℂ \ {w}` from the boundary loop to a constant, forcing the boundary winding number to
vanish. -/
