# Radius obstruction carried by an odd Section 4 circle mesh

With `2k+1` inserted circle vertices the affine mesh has `2k+2`
subintervals, so its central inserted vertex is the exact angular midpoint.
The two retained boundary endpoints and that midpoint therefore certify the
minimal radius whenever the completion arc spans at least a semicircle.
