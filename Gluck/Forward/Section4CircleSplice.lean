# The explicit finite circle splice in Dahlberg Section 4

The auxiliary polygon keeps the enlarged positive-curvature run and then
returns from its right endpoint to its left endpoint through a finite ordered
mesh on the minimal circle.  This file defines that cyclic vertex map and
records its basic indexing identities.
