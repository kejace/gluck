# Alternating disk paths cross

Two paths contained in a closed Euclidean disk, whose four distinct endpoints
occur alternately on the boundary circle, must intersect.  The proof uses the
project's source-free winding-number engine: under a disjointness assumption,
the path-difference loop on the parameter-square boundary contracts through
nonzero loops, but a homotopy to the two crossing chords identifies the same
loop with the boundary of a nonsingular affine parallelogram, whose winding is
`±1`.

Endpoint-avoidance hypotheses are explicit.  They are exactly what simple
polygonal subchains provide and are what makes the straight-line homotopy from
each path to its chord stay away from the opposite fixed boundary endpoint.

/-- **Disk crosscut theorem.**  If the endpoints of two disk-contained paths
lie on opposite sides of the other boundary chord, then the paths intersect.
The strict side conditions make the two chords transverse and put their
intersection in the open disk; chord coordinates and gauge rescaling reduce
the claim to `paths_intersect_of_square_normalized`. -/
