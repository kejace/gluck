# Local clearance from nonincident polygon edges

A vertex of a finite simple polygon has a positive-radius neighborhood which
misses any prescribed finite block of nonincident edges.  This is the local
stability input used when a boundary contact is perturbed by a tiny circle
detour in the three-contact orientation argument.

/-- The initial vertex of a simple polygon has a uniformly positive-radius
neighborhood disjoint from every edge in the natural block `m, …, n - 2`.
The hypotheses `1 < m` and `m < n` make all these edges nonincident to the
initial edge and exclude the final edge returning to vertex zero. -/
