# Reconstruction and the closure condition

Given a positive radius-of-curvature weight `ρ = 1/κ`, the source builds a plane
curve by integrating the unit tangent `e^{iθ}` against `ρ`. This file records
that reconstruction and the precise condition for the resulting curve to close
up.

The *reconstruction curve* is `α_ρ(θ) = ∫₀^θ e^{iφ} ρ(φ) dφ ∈ ℂ`; it begins at
the origin and has velocity `α_ρ'(θ) = e^{iθ} ρ(θ)`. The curve closes up (extends
to a `2π`-periodic curve) exactly when the *error vector*
`E(ρ) = α_ρ(2π) = ∫₀^{2π} e^{iθ} ρ(θ) dθ` vanishes, equivalently when both
closure integrals `C(ρ) = ∫₀^{2π} cos θ ρ(θ) dθ` and
`S(ρ) = ∫₀^{2π} sin θ ρ(θ) dθ` vanish.

`α_ρ(θ) = ∫₀^θ e^{iφ} ρ(φ) dφ ∈ ℂ`, the complex form of the source's
